= Development and execution environments

* Similar to the development and execution environment used in other courses,
such as PG, AED, or TDS.
    ** Mainly just a refresher.

* Programs to be (mostly) executed in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
    ** Using the concurrency model provided by the JVM.
    ** Independent of the operating system.

* Programs (mostly) developed using the Kotlin language
    ** Targeting the JVM, i.e., producing .class/.jar files with bytecode.
    ** Also using the concurrency model provided by the Kotlin language.

* Development environment
    ** Intellij or other equivalent IDE
        *** Teaching staff can help with IntelliJ issues.
        *** No license required (i.e. equivalent to community edition).
    ** Gradle build system
        *** The "source of truth" about the project organization and build procedures.
        *** It should be possible to run and test all the programs and functions without using IntelliJ.
    ** Build system
        *** The process of turning source files (e.g. .kt files) into executable artifacts (e.g. .jar files).
        *** Including
            **** Fetching external dependencies such as libraries.
            **** Compiling the source files into .class files.
            **** Running the tests.
            **** Running other verifications tasks, such as stylistic verification using ktlint.
            **** Packing the multiple .class files into a single .jar file.

* IMPORTANT: In my demos I'll be using a `zsh` shell running on macOS.
    ** Using a `bash` or `zsh` shell on Linux will be very similar
    ** Using a `CMD` or `powershell` shell on Windows may be slightly different

* This shouldn't new to any students. Just reviewing and setting a common ground.

* In both repositories used in this course
    ** The root for the JVM project is NOT the repository root.
    ** The JVM project is typically located inside a `code/jvm` folder.

* Demo
    ** Create temporary folder and clone both repositories
    ** Run `./gradlew check` on both
    ** Debugging
        *** Check if java is available - `java --version`
        *** Check if gradlew is available to start and what is the java version being used `./gradlew --version`
    ** Open IntelliJ in one of the projects
        *** Note the file being opened
        *** Check that the project import process didn't produce any errors
        *** Check `File > Project Structure...`
